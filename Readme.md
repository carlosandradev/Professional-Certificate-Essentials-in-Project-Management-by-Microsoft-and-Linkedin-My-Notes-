## 1. Get to know Project Management

### What is a Project
* A Project is a temporary endeavor that has an unique goal and usually a budget.
* Temporary endeavor: A project has a definite beginning and end.
* If the project is implementing a new system, the project is done when you successfully hand it over to operations.
* What if the project seems to go on forever? it could be that you haven't clearly defined what you're trying to acomplish.
* Project Goal: A project produces a unique result wich could be a product, service or other outcome.
* Most projects have budgets. Most of the time you think money when you hear the word budget.
* You may also have to question about the available resources.
* The hospital scheduling system is a project because it has an specific beginning
* It ends when the system is up and running, scheduling hospital resourses.
* It has a unique goal to solve the hospital scheduling issues and it has a budget both in money and resource's time.
* Thinking about the characteristics of a project you can check the different projects you had in your life.

### What is Project Management?

* Can be summed up as answering a few crucial questions.
* What problem are you solving? Clearly defining what the project is supposed to acomplish.
* How are you doing to solve this problem? you might have to choose from several possible strategies.
* Then it's time to flesh out a solution. Gathering requirements, identifying deliverables, and defining project scope.
* What is your plan? You have to identify the work to be done in detail, how long it might take, resources, cost.
* Build a schedule of when the work should occur. How do you want things to happen in your project, like communication
* managing changes and so on. 
* How will you know when youa are done? Clearly define objectives, requirements, and deliverables help answer this.
* You can eliminate uncertainty by defining success criteria: quantifiable, measurable results that show that the project is complete.
* At the end of the project you can answer the last question.
* How well did the project go?
* You need time to review the project. What worked well, what didn't? Why? What could have done better?

*summarize*
* What problem are you solving?
* How are you going to solve it?
* What's your plan for getting the project done?
* How can you tell when you're done?
* How well did the project go?

<br>

### What it takes to be a project manager
* You need technical skills specific to project management. What goes into a project plan?
* Building and fine tuning project shcedule. Reading a Gantt chart. Using the critical path and measuring performance.
* Business expertise. It depends to you to make your project delivers value. You need to understand your organization's business.
* What it does and what it considers important. That way you can see how your project fits in and you can make good decisions.
* Problem solving is an essential skill. Projects never go according to plan. Your job is to figure out how to achieve project objectives and meet the schedule and budget, while working around the problem that arise.
* Interpersonal skills. Projects may need diferent people from different areas. You are a leader of this group so it's your job to help everyone work as a team to get the project done well.
* Strong Leadership. Inspire your people, help them become a true team. Guide them to do the right things, hold them accountable, and motivate then to give their best.

### The Waterfall project management lifecycle

* The traditional waterfall project management life cycle, can be broken into 5 stages or phases that help guide a project successfully from beginning to end.
* Initiating is all about getting the commitment to start a project.
* You start by defining a project. What's the project supposed to acomplish? What's de scope?
* What's a tough estimate of the resources needed and the cost?
* You also identify the project stakeholders, and make sure they agree on what the project is. 
* Ask for approval to proceed.
* Planning is where you work with small team of expert team members to figure out how you're going to do?
* Planning answers the questions: What are we going to do? How are we going to do it? How will we know when you're done?
* When Planning is complete it's time to get approval to launch the project.
* The next two areas involve putting your plan into action.
* Executing starts with launching a project. You bring your full team resources on board, get them settled in and explain the rules you're using to run the project.
* After that everyone jumps in to put the plan into action.
* Monitoring and controlling a project means cheking what's going on in the project and how that compares to what you planned.
* If the project is sliding off track, you taken action to get it back on track.
* Managing and controlling occurs throughout most of the project life cycle, starting during initiation, and wrapping up when you close the project.
* Closing the project. This part is short but important.
* You get the client to approve the project, that is officially accept that the project is complete.
* You document the project performance, gather lessons learned, close contracts, and help resources move on to their next assignments.
* Waterfall project management works well when the project goal and solution are clearly defined, and the scope and deliverables are clear cut, such as in building construction.
* Because you understand what needs to be done, you step through each stage once from start to finish.
* The more you know about the project, the better the Waterfall approach works.
* Straightfordward projects with very little uncertainity are great candidates, because you know what needs to be donde and how to handle issues that arise.

<br>

### The Agile Project management lifecycle

* When you don't know what the solution looks like, or how to build it, so you have to figure it out as you go.
* This type of project requires a different approach.
* With Agile projects, the team works on sprints to deliver a partial set of features that are production quality at regular intervals.
* With this approach the customer gets value
